This file has to be copied into the root vendor/etc/fstab.qcom to enable F2FS support.  This can be done with a root browser (Magisk installed).

This is flashed after the kernel is patched with Magisk and modifies the default fstab.qcom
The included fstab.qcom also makes barrier=0 instead of barrier=1 for speed improvements on EXT4, only enabled on data and cache.
There is no reason to use F2F2 on the other partitions or any other speed settings, as they are read only.

The entire source code here is for China based ROMs (Xiaomi.eu, MIUI, RevOS) and Android Pie (9). 
Android Q has a different DTBO.img and causes a flash to fail. Code source is closed at this point so unable to fix.
