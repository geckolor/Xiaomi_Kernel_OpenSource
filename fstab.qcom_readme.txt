This file has to be inserted into the ROM in vendor/etc/fstab.qcom, possibly 1 other place.
The best way to do this would be to leverage the pre-existing script that modifies all instances of this using AK3, disable dm-verity located here:
https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/universal-dm-verity-forceencrypt-t3817389
Sourcecode: https://github.com/Zackptg5/Disable_Dm-Verity_ForceEncrypt 

This is flashed after the kernel is flashed with Magisk and modifies fstab.qcom
The included fstab.qcom also makes barrier=0 instead of barrier=1 for speed improvements so EXT4 should also be faster per Pappschlumpf of the super tweaked OP7 PRO kernel.  He said he uses that
instead of F2FS and it brings great improvement, only enabled on data and cache
There is no reason to use F2F2 or speed improvements on the other partitions as it doesn't help.

Note that also this build has not been confirmed to work on 9.8.1 Xiaomi as of yet
The entire source code here is for China based ROMs (Xiaomi.eu, MIUI, RevOS) and hasn't been tested
On anything except MIUI and Xiaomi.eu (pre 9.8.1)
